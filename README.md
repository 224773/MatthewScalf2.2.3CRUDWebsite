I used cloud 9 and my phpmyadmin
My website is a list of videogames which has their genre. You start using it by putting in a videogame title and its genre and then clicking submit. This will put it into the table in the database. When you click find it will show all of the entries in the database in a table. You can then click update which will change the genre of the most recent game. This change will also show up in the table. Finally you can delete an entry by clicking on the delete button. This will delete the most recent entry in the list from the table and database.
